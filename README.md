# Teaching Big Data and Platforms for Big Data

What should we teach students about big data platforms. In this site, I write lectures, hands-on, lessons learned, etc. for teaching Big Data Platforms, a topic that I have given in  universities through my academic jobs and in companies through my professional consulting services.

Currently, the university course given by me is   in [Aalto MyCourses](https://mycourses.aalto.fi/course/view.php?id=24363),is site just keeps some public/supplement materials for the Big Data Platforms course 2019 at CS Department, Aalto University, whereas [topics for companies can be found in my consulting site](http://truong.rdsea.io/courses/BigDataTraining-OverviewModule.pdf).
