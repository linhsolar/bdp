# Teaching Big Data and Platforms for Big Data

What should we teach students about big data platforms. In this site, I write lectures, hands-on, lessons learned, etc. for teaching Big Data Platforms, a topic that I have given in  universities through my academic jobs and in companies through my professional consulting services.

## Courses
* The university course given by me is   [Big Data Platforms in Aalto University](https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/bigdataplatforms/cs-e4640). Follow the link to check some public/supplement materials for the Big Data Platforms.
* [Industrial training can be found in my consulting site](http://truong.rdsea.io/courses/BigDataTraining-OverviewModule.pdf).
